Please populate the db username, password, server and database name as below:

const connectionConfig = {
    userName: 'DATABASE USERNAME',
    password: 'DATABASE PASSWORD',
    server: 'DATABASE SERVER',
    options: {
        encrypt: true,
        database: 'DATABASE TABLE NAME'
    }
};

# Database Setup
This API uses a table called userData
There is a schema folder within the root containing the create schema for the userData table. 
Run this statement to create the table needed to run CRUD operations using the provided API.

Launch API
To Launch the API please follow the below:
1)	Run npm-install to install the api dependencies
